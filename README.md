# Natours

This project was created by following Jonas Schmedtmann's Advance CSS and SASS course.

The project is built with float-layout with pure CSS/SASS (without JS or any libraries). The goal of the project was to learn BEM convention, pseudo selectors, animations, responsive images (art-direction, density-switching), responsive design and methods to support different browsers.
